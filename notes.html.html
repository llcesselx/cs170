        <h2>3 Cool Things HTML Has to Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Titles, Icons and totally tabular customization. Super cool.</li>
          <li>Seeing as how there are SO many options and styling features and interactivity by combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript; The options on a created website are pretty much limitless. It's pretty dope if you think about it because if there is a way to make something work then I believe there is totally a way. Especially with computers.</li>
          <li>Another thing I think is interesting, is the manipulation. It kind of goes into my second reason but manipulating code to do what you want is just still fascinating as fudge.</li>
