# Course Tools 

## 1) Sublime Editor (`Preferences.sublime-settings`)
Follow the tutorial on Installing and Configuring Sublime Editor. Install all relevant packages and make all the changes to your settings. Once completed, you'll need to find your Sublime configuration file which should be located in your user's Home directory. To locate the file, in sublime, click the menu `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages`, and a file explorer windows should open in the `Packages` directory. To receive credit for this part of the lab, you will need to add the preferences specified below to your Sublime preferences file (`Preferences.sublime-settings`), then use an SFTP Client to copy the preferences file to the CS Server. Place it in this location on the CS Server `~/labs/lab1/Preferences.sublime-settings`. You can change the settings to your own personal preference, but to get full credit you must have a least 4 different settings that are different from the defaults.

## 2) Install NodeJS (`nodejs.png`)
If you have not already, watch and follow along with the Web Development Tools tutorial. Make sure you follow the steps to configure Sublime and ESLint. Open a terminal or command line on whatever OS you use and determine the version of NodeJS you have installed.

### Windows, MacOS, and Linux
Take a screenshot of just the terminal window showing that you have the proper version of node installed, and name the file `nodejs.png` (or some other image file extension, like `.jpg`, or `.bmp`). If you take a full-screen screenshot you will lose points. You are to install this on your own machine, so screenshots from running this command on the CS Server will not be counted.

## 3) Installing and Configuring ESLint Code Linter
### Files (Naming Matters!)
* `.eslintrc.js`
* `eslint-errors.png`
* `eslint-fixed.png`
* `linterTest.js`
ESLint is a code linter, which is a program that scans your code and can make it cleaner (like a lint brush going over a shirt). Code linters are extremely helpful tools because they can help prevent you from making numerous simple mistakes. They cannot fix everything, but the can fix a lot.

From the previous tutorial make sure you followed the instructions to install and configure ESLint for use with the Sublime. In that tutorial it instructs you to create a text file that intentionally has coding errors. Create that file and save it, then take a screenshot of the code in Sublime with the linter errors, and call it `eslint-errors.png`. It should looks something like the image in the tutorial.

Next fix the errors as the tutorial suggests, and take another screenshot without the linter errors. Call this file `eslint-fixed.png`.

Also include the file `linterTest.js` in your lab submission with the corrected code from the tutorial.

## 4) Installing and Configuring HTMLHint (HINT not LINT) Code Linter
### Files
* `.htmlhintrc`
* `htmlhint-errors.png`
* `htmlhint-fixed.png`
* `linter-test.html`
HTMLHint is a code linter, which is a program that scans your code and can make it cleaner (like a lint brush going over a shirt). Code linters are extremely helpful tools because they can help prevent you from making numerous simple mistakes. They cannot fix everything, but the can fix a lot. 

From the previous tutorial make sure you followed the instructions to install and configure HTMLHint for use with the Sublime. In that tutorial it instructs you to create a text file that intentionally has coding errors. Create that file and save it, then take a screenshot of the code in Sublime with the linter errors, and call it `htmlhint-errors.png`. It should looks something like the image in the tutorial.

Next fix the errors as the tutorial suggests, and take another screenshot without the linter errors. Call this file `htmlhint-fixed.png`.
